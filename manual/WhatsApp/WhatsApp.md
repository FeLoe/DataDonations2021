# WhatsApp Manual
This is an instruction manual for retrieving WhatsApp data using the mobile lab procedure. If followed correctly, it delivers the following outcomes:
* Anonymized (hashed) data on news consumption and sharing on WhatsApp on a drive owned by the researcher;
* Raw data on an external drive (exact location to be decided);
* Visualizations of the participant's WhatsApp use, to be presented directly to the participant.

Please read these instructions carefully and proceed only if you are sure about which steps to take next. WhatsApp data is very privacy-sensitive and should therefore be handled with care.

## 1  Retrieve WhatsApp info
Retrieving WhatsApp data works slightly different for different phone operating systems. We have incorporated user manuals for the two most common ones: Android and iOS. Both manuals are designed to be user-friendly even for audiences with low digital literacy.
