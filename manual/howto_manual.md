## Instructions on how to write a manual page
The manual pages are an essential part not only of the documentation but also of the workflow of the mobile lab since it includes everything from technical instructions to takeout instructions. This manual of the manual gives an overview of the steps you should take to make a new manual page and contribute to the project. 

### Step 1: Assigning yourself to the task
We have open tasks under "issues". If the manual page you intend to write is already an open issue, assign yourself to it so that others know that you will be handling this task. If it is not an issue yet, you can just create a new one. 
### Step 2: Making a new branch 
Read the instructions on how to make a new branch in the [online interface](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) or via the [terminal](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches). Always make sure that you pull the latest version of the master before creating your new branch. 
### Step 3: Creating the manual page
The purpose of the manual pages is twofold: It acts as documentation for the project, but also as instruction for the participants in the mobile lab. You should keep in mind while writing it that it is also accessible for non-academics and you should try to incorporate visuals when possible. All of the manual pages should be written as markdown documents. If you are not familiar with markdown, you can find a quick instruction [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)(also very useful for people who constantly forget the syntax..). And don't forget to push your changes on a regular basis!
### Step 4: Creating a pull request
Once you think that the manual page is finished, you should create a pull request to merge your branch to the master branch. 
More info on how to do this [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). You should then assign someone to review the changes that you have made - you can just assign them as reviewer. Who you select as reviewer is up to you. 

### Pro tip: 
You can also embed GIFs into the manual pages, which might be especially helpful for instructions on where to click etc.
