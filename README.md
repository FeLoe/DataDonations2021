# Lab2020
In this repository, you can find the material for organising a Mobile Lab for collecting different data takeouts (such as Facebook, Twitter etc) as well as collecting (synced) browsing histories from participants on the spot. 

The general idea is that people only need to bring their phone, all of the data extraction can be done from this. This repository includes
- Descriptions of what resources are needed (in terms of technical equipment etc)
- Description of the workflow while being out in the field
- Links to example questionnaires
- Instructions for participants for doing the takeouts (Dutch and English?)
- Data management plan showing a way of doing this research in a privacy-sensitive way
- Scripts for processsing the raw data files
- Scripts for making visualizations of the processed data (for analysis but also for showing/giving it to participants)
- Preregistrations for studies
